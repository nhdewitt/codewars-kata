Task
Given an array of integers , Find the maximum product obtained from multiplying 2 adjacent numbers in the array. Note that the array size is at least 2 and consists a mixture of positive, negative integers and also zeroes.

Examples
[1, 2, 3] returns 6 because the maximum product is obtained from multiplying 2âˆ—3=6
[9, 5, 10, 2, 24, -1, -48] returns 50 because the maximum product is obtained from multiplying 5*10=50
[-23, 4, -5, 99, -27, 329, -2, 7, -921] returns -14 because the maximum product is obtained from multiplying -2*7=-14
